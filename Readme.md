# Reverse Proxy for [Jobe](https://github.com/trampgeek/jobe)

## What's this thing?

### It's a [reverse proxy ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy) made to proxy multiple Jobe Sandboxes for load distrubution.

It follows Jobe's API so it can be deployed without changing Coderunner and Jobe's code.

Coderunner sees it as a normal Jobe and Jobe sees it as a normal client.

## How to install?

See [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md)
